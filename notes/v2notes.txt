Ideas for the structure of the project
-------------------------
  • Each PR season should be encapsulated inside an instance of a "Season" class.
    – These seasons can contain all of the methods required to get the data from the database
      and manipulate it.
    – Seasons would be defined (from this point forward) according to their active dates.

  • Each player would be an instance of a "Player" class.
    – These objects should contain all of the methods needed to generate player-specific statistics.

Tournaments and matches do not need to be their own classes, as they're really just data that the
seasons class should be manipulating, and mongoose will already put the objects in the correct
configuration.

Modules
  • schemas.js
  • get-data.js
  • queries.js
  • seasons.js
  • players.js

  These are mostly just theoretical ideas for how this project could be organized. I'm not sure
exactly how modular it should be, but I kind of like the idea of many small modules that have clear
purposes as opposed to a few massive modules that define lots of functionality.
