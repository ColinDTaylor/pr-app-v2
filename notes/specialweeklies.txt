Brackets in a different place than normal:
  1: bracket is on the 'Absolome' challonge account
  2: bracket was on paper, no challogne equivalent exists & it'd throw things off to make one now (dates would be wrong)
  3: bracket is on the 'TS3D' challonge account, has url 'smasheville122' but I asked him to change it

No singles bracket:
  8, 16

Other special cases:
  15: bracket had 2 pools, the usual url is just the top 8, pools @ smasheville15p1/15p2
