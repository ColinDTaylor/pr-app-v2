Major Stuff
------------------------------
- Port over the survey front end from old project butt better this time (jquery?)
- Create literally any sort of front end for dev

- I want to make a page that lists every single unique tag next to a dropdown menu and an
  'associate' button, which would allow us to easily associate aliases w/ people's primary tags

  this would require a LOT of backend, starting with some kind of list of each participant's
  primary tag.

- We need modules for 3 different classes: Seasons, Players, & Tournaments.
